# promptica

**promptica** is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for building **structured, reliable, and scalable** Large Language Model prompting workflows.

It bridges the gap between traditional programming logic and LLM-driven reasoning—bringing engineering discipline to AI-native systems.

## Why Promptica?

Many real-world AI scenarios require a combination of:

* **Structured control flow** (sequences, conditionals, loops, retries)
* **Human-like decision-making** powered by LLMs
* **Flexible reasoning** that does not fit neatly into rigid code

In these cases, traditional programming languages are often too verbose and inflexible, while pure prompt chaining is fragile, hard to debug, and difficult to scale.

A dedicated DSL provides a pragmatic middle ground.

## The Value Proposition

**promptica** enables teams to:

* Explicitly model **control flow** without burying logic in glue code
* Treat **LLM reasoning as a first-class construct**
* Improve **readability, maintainability, and reuse** of prompt logic
* Evolve from prototype to production without constant rewrites

The result is faster iteration, clearer intent, and more robust LLM-powered workflows.

## Motivation

After experimenting with multiple existing DSLs and prompt orchestration approaches, I continuously refined my own methodology through real-world practice. Most existing solutions were either too close to traditional programming languages or too unstructured for production use.

**promptica** represents a distilled implementation of those learnings—designed to be minimal, expressive, and practical for LLM-integrated development.
